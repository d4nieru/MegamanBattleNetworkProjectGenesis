# About this project

MMBN Project Genesis is a fan game of the MegaMan Battle Network games. Made by people who didn't like the ending of 6 and thought the game should continue after CX, the game takes place 2 years after 6, and follows the mysteries of MegaMan, Omega, and over a dozen new characters.

# A little backstory behind this Fan Project
The game was originally made by **SpookyDookie** and **The Zenith Serene** and built in Gamemaker Studio 1.4.1690

But since they stopped the development of the project due to personal reasons and the various dramas hovering around the team, I decided to take the source code of the game (with their permission of course, the proofs of the permission can be found in the "proof" folder of the repo) and potentially use it to inspire me and create a brand new project related to the Megaman Battle Network franchise. However several years later, I didn't have the use of this source code and knowing that I won't use the engine used by this game and that it would be a pity to lose it, I decided to post **the source code of Megaman Battle Network Project Genesis** here for those who have always been curious about the backstage of fan games and especially about the code and its functioning.

WARNING : The code is more than 5 years old (at the time of writing this page) and therefore contains beginner's errors and can be incomprehensible at times :v
